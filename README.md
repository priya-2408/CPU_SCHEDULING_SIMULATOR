# CPU_SCHEDULING_SIMULATOR
To develop a program that prompts the user to input the number of processes, their burst times, and for Round Robin scheduling, the time quantum. It then allows the user to choose one of the mentioned scheduling algorithms(FCFS ,SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Disk Scheduling) . The program calculates and displays the waiting time and turnaround time for each process. Additionally, it provides the average waiting time and average turnaround time for the selected scheduling algorithm. The user is also given the option to implement another scheduling algorithm or to exit the program.
