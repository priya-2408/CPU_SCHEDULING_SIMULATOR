# CPU SCHEDULING SIMULATOR
To develop a program that prompts the user to input the number of processes, their burst times, and for Round Robin scheduling, the time quantum. It then allows the user to choose one of the mentioned scheduling algorithms(FCFS ,SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Disk Scheduling) . The program calculates and displays the waiting time and turnaround time for each process. Additionally, it provides the average waiting time and average turnaround time for the selected scheduling algorithm. The user is also given the option to implement another scheduling algorithm or to exit the program.

# Scheduling Algorithms:
Depending on the user's choice, the program should execute the selected scheduling algorithm.
Here's a brief overview of how each algorithm works:
 - First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS): The processes are executed in the order they 
arrive.
 - Shortest Job First (SJF): The process with the shortest burst time is executed 
first.
 - Round Robin: Each process gets a fixed time quantum to execute in a cyclic 
manner. If a process doesn't complete in the time quantum, it's moved to the end of the 
queue.
 - Priority Disk Scheduling: Processes are executed based on their priority levels. 
The process with the highest priority goes first.
